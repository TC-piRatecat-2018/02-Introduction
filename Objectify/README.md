## Data Structures - vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data frames
* Data contained as vectors, matrices, and arrays are homogeneous.
* Lists and data frames are heterogeneous.
* Indices start at 1, not 0.
* Each row is a single observation.
* Each column is a single variable of the same data type.

### Vectors
* _atomic_: logical, integer, double, character, complex, raw
* _lists_: recursive vectors (you can have a list of lists)
* _augmented vectors_: factors, dates, date-times, tibbles

### _Arrays_
Arrays are like vectors with a dimensional attribute.

### _Matrices_
Matrices are like two dimensional arrays.

### Data Frames (and Tibbles)
A data frame is a what one would commonly think of as a table (your typical spreadsheet). A tibble is a type of data frame that retains the data type (e.g. character, date, integer) for each attribute (column).

### Lists
